Chapter 1 - first program

Chapter 2 - Operator
2+3 gives 5
3-2 gives 1
2*5 gives 10
6/3 gives 2.0
6//3 gives 2
7%2 gives remainder i.e. 1
2**3 means 2 power 3 gives 8

2*5/4+5-2**3/(2+6) will follow PEMDAS 
when multiple operations are given
P Parenthesis
E Exponent
M Multiplication
D Division
A Addition
S Subtraction



Chapter 3 - Strings
if you add # before any string it becomes comment which is not executable
 string = print("hello world")
 comment = #print("hello world")

you may use single, double or tripple quotes whatever you like or require.

print("what's up") 
here double quotes required



Chapter 4 - Comments
use # or ctrl + / for commentout (string you dont want to execute)

print("whats up?") #learning python
print(2+3) #learning operators in python




Chapter 5 - Variables
x = 5
print(x)
if you write print(type(x)) then it will give <class 'int'> as 5 is an integer

y = "I am learning python."
print(y)
if you write print(type(y)) then it will give <class 'str'> as "I am learning python." is a string.

Rules to assign a variable
1. The variable should contain letters, numbers or underscores
2. Dont start with number i.e. 2x or 2y
3. Spaces are not allowed i.e. space space x space y
4. Dont use keywords used in python functions (see image Keywords)
5. Short and Descriptive
6. Case senstivity (lowercase letters, uppercase letters - lowercase letters should be used)

fruitbasket = "mangoes"
print(fruitbasket) gives mangoes

if you write
fruitbasket = "mangoes"
del fruitbasket
print(fruitbasket) gives error because you have deleted fruit basket.



Chapter 6 - input variables
fruitbasket = input("what is your favourite fruit?")
print(fruitbasket)

2nd stage input function
name = input("what is your name?")
print("hello" , name)
will ask your name, you type your name and it will then give "hello Afzal"

3rd stage input function
name = input("what is your name?")
age = input("what is your age?")
greetings = "Hello"
print(greetings , name , "you are still young") 


Chapter 7 Conditional Logics (see image by same name)
hammad_age = 4
age_at_school_required = 5
print(hammad_age == age_at_school_required)

 input function + logical operator
age_at_school_required = 5
hammad_age = input("what is hammad's age? ")
hammad_age = int(hammad_age)
print(hammad_age==age_at_school_required)



Chapter 8 - Type Conversion
x = 8
print(type(x)) gives <class 'int'>

y = 10.2
print(type(y)) gives <class 'float'>

z = "Hello"
print(type(z)) gives <class 'str'>

when an integer is multiplied/divided by a float or a float is multiplied/divided by an integer 
the resulting value is always a float in python.

when an integer is added/subtracted to/from a float or a float is added/subtracted to/from an integer 
the resulting value is always a float in python.

implicit type conversion
x = x+y
print(x, "type of x is" , type(x)) gives 18.2 type of x is <class 'float'>
similarly
x = x*y
print(x, "type of x is" , type(x)) gives 185.64 type of x is <class 'float'>

explicit type conversion
age = input("what is your age?")
age = int(age)
print(age, type(age))
gives
what is your age?33
33 <class 'int'>

age = input("what is your age?")
print(age, type(int(age)))
gives
what is your age?34
34 <class 'int'>



Chapter 9 - if else/elif Statements
hammad_age = input("what is hammad's age? ")
hammad_age = int(hammad_age)
age_required_at_school = 5

you may insert as many elif calauses as you want e.g.
hammad_age = int(input("what is hammad's age? "))
age_required_at_school = 5
if hammad_age==age_required_at_school:
    print("Hammad can join school.")
elif hammad_age>age_required_at_school:
    print("Hammad can join higher classes.")

else:
    print("Hammad can not join school.")

gives
what is hammad's age? 2
you should take care of Hammad, he is still a baby.



Chapter 10 - Functions
3 ways of defining

def print_codanics(text):
    print(text)
    print(text)
    print(text)
print_codanics("I am learning python.")

def print_codanics():
    print("I am learning python.")
    print("I am learning python.")
    print("I am learning python.")
print_codanics()

def print_codanics():
    text = "I am learning python."
    print(text)
    print(text)
    print(text)
print_codanics()

All the 3 ways give
I am learning python.
I am learning python.
I am learning python.

Chapter 11 - Loops
two kinds of loops 1: while loops , 2: for loops

#1: while loops
x = 0
while (x <= 5):
    print(x)
    x = x+1
gives
0
1
2
3
4
5

#2: for loops
for x in range(4,11):
    print(x)
gives
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

#array
days = ["Mon" , "Tue" , "Wed" , "Thu" , "Fri" , "Sat" , "Sun"]
for d in days:
    print(d)
gives
Mon
Tue
Wed
Thu
Fri
Sat
Sun

days = ["Mon" , "Tue" , "Wed" , "Thu" , "Fri" , "Sat" , "Sun"]
for d in days:
    if d==fri: break #stops loop at d
    print(d)
gives
Mon
Tue
Wed
Thu

days = ["Mon" , "Tue" , "Wed" , "Thu" , "Fri" , "Sat" , "Sun"]
for d in days:
    if d=="Fri": continue #skips d
    print(d)
gives
Mon
Tue
Wed
Thu
Sat
Sun


Chapter 12 - Import Libraries
Libraries e.g. math , statistics , numpy , pandas

#if we want to print value of pi
import math
print("The value of pi is " , math.pi)
gives
The value of pi is  3.141592653589793

import statistics
x = [150,250,350,450]
print(statistics.mean(x))
gives
300


Chapter 13 - Trouble Shooting
print(we are learning python with Ammar)
gives Syntax error because we haven't put inverted commas at start and end of our sentence.

print(25/0)
gives runtime error(math error).

name = Afzal
print("Hello name")  #correct ("Hello" , name)
gives symantic error (the most difficult error)
